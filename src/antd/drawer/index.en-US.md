A panel which slides in from the edge of the screen.

## When To Use

A Drawer is a panel that is typically overlaid on top of a page and slides in from the side. It contains a set of information or actions. Since the user can interact with the Drawer without leaving the current page, tasks can be achieved more efficiently within the same context.

- Use a Form to create or edit a set of information.
- Processing subtasks. When subtasks are too heavy for a Popover and we still want to keep the subtasks in the context of the main task, Drawer comes very handy.
- When the same Form is needed in multiple places.
